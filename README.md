## Notes

`GTA: City of Lost Heaven` was originally released in [2005 by Deniska](https://gtaforums.com/topic/177544-city-of-lost-heaven/). All of the dialog and text in the game were changed to Russian with an English version planned but never fully delivered. The aim of this repo if to create a proper English translation for City of Lost Heaven so that fans in the west can finally enjoy playing it.
