# gta-city-of-lost-heaven

## Development

1. Use [GXT Extractor](https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/GXT-Extractor) to get the original VC English translations extracted to text files by running `python gxt-extract.py TEXT/american.gxt` inside the Vice City installation directory.
1. Do the same for the translations for "City of Lost Heaven", compare the differences and translate them back to English.

## Notes

Vc Limit Adjuster Settings that work fine for me

- Steaming memory = 75
- Buildings = 9000
- Dummys = 4000
