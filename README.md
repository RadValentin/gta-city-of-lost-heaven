# gta-city-of-lost-heaven

## Development

1. Use [GXT Extractor](https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/GXT-Extractor) to unpack the mod's transation files by running  `python gxt-extract.py mod/american.gxt`.
1. Notice that the extracted files don't have the proper encoding so many non-latin characters are not showing properly.
1. Get an upacked Russing translation from [Vice-City-Russian-1C-GXT](https://github.com/DelmorS/Vice-City-Russian-1C-GXT) and spend hours comparing lines of text, replacing broken characters for words that look to match between the two transaltions.

## Notes
