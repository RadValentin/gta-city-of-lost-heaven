COK4_14	You want some of this?!
COK4_15	Sleep with the fish!
COK4_16	Eat it! EAT IT!
COK4_19	More trouble up ahead!
COK4_20	There are gunmen on that jetty!
COK4_24	Good shooting, my friend. You're a real, proper, grade A lunatic.
COK4_25	Well, thank you.
COK4_26	See you around, Tommy.
COK4_27	Okay, Mr. Lance Vance Dance.
COK4_28	~g~Get to the yacht before the other boats do!
COK4_3	So why the hell are we running errands for him?
COK4_31	~g~Go to the fastest boat at the jetty!
COK4_32	~r~Too slow!
COK4_33	~r~You destroyed the boat!
COK4_34	~g~Take those boats out!
COK4_35	Boat health:
COK4_4	The more we learn now, the less we have to learn when we take this town over!
COK4_5	I like your style, man. Real fresh.
COK4_A	Eject! PLASTIC CRAP!
COK4_B	You doing this to me?
COK4_C	Who do you think you are, you piece of plastic SHIT? Aaarrgh!
COK4_D	SCREW YOU!
COK4_E	It eats my favorite El burro movie, it die!
COK4_F	What else could I do?
COK4_G	It's probably not plugged in.
COK4_H	What?
COK4_I	Damn - no matter, I can buy a hundred more.
COK4_J	Now Tommy,
COK4_K	each month a freelancer sails into Vice City and moors his yacht.
COK4_L	He sells his cargo to the first boat.
COK4_M	I want you to take the speedboat
COK4_N	and beat all the other shitheads to it,
COK4_O	then you bring the cargo here, ok!?
COK4_P	Let me guess, you thought I could use a guardian angel.
COK4_Q	I'm just saying you need to let me in there, my man.
COK4_R	Now you can feed me all this 'lonely tough guy' crap,
COK4_S	but I know one day I'm gonna save your ass,
COK4_T	and you're probably gonna wanna kiss me!
COK4_U	Wacko.
COK4_V	Hahahahahaha!
