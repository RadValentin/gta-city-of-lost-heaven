COL5A_1	Circumstances force a hasty departure, amigo.
COL5A_2	What's the problem?
COL5A_3	Ehh, the French want their missile technology back and after that last incident,
COL5A_4	I feel it is time to find safer harbors.
COL5A_5	Wouldn't it be safer to fly?
COL5A_6	I'd be dead before I reached check-in. Besides, I need to get my merchandise out of the country.
COL5A_7	Need another gun?
COL5A_8	You, my friend, are worth ten guns...
COL5B_1	Thomas, you have protected and served me well.
COL5B_2	But now you must leave us before we reach the open seas.
COL5B_3	I will lower my personal launch. Keep it, my friend, a token of my gratitude.
COL5B_4	Thank you, Colonel.
COL5B_5	One more request. While I'm away, could you keep an eye on Mercedes for me?
COL5B_6	I think she could look after herself, but sure, I'll keep an eye out.
COL5B_7	Gracias, amigo. Hasta luego.
COL5B_8	Adios, amigo.
COL5_1	Port side! Port side!
COL5_10	I have diplomatic immunity!
COL5_11	Don't shoot, I am a Colonel!
