TEX1_2	~g~Now head to the Leaf Links Golf Club.
TEX1_3	Who's this guy? Boys, deal with him.
TEX1_6	Nice ass baby!
TEX1_7	Is this me?
TEX1_8	Each time you enter a caddy you automatically receive a golf club, providing your melee weapon slot is empty.
TEX1_9	Get him!
TEX1_A	Come in and park yourself on the hide, son.
TEX1_B	Hell, my daddy used to say, never look a gift horse in the mouth, and by golly, he never did.
TEX1_C	Would you like a drop of the old Kentucky?
TEX1_D	No thanks.
TEX1_E	A clean thinker! I like that.
TEX1_F	Now, the property business isn't all about high-falootin' paper pushing.
TEX1_G	It's about dirt! And the will to claim that dirt! You with me, son?
TEX1_H	Oh yeah.
TEX1_I	Well, I need some tenacious bastard to let go of some dirt,
TEX1_J	and you look to me like the kind of guy to persuade him.
TEX1_K	Persuasion's my forte.
TEX1_L	Yeh, he'll be down at the country club, down on the golf course.
TEX1_M	They don't allow guns, so his bodyguards won't be packing lawgivers.
TEX1_N	Go beat eight tons of crap out of him.
TEX1_O	Here now - I got you a membership, and boy you're going to need more appropriate clothing.
