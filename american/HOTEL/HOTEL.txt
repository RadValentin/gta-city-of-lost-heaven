INTB_A	Tommy! Tommy, it's been too long.
INTB_B	Hello Sonny.
INTB_C	I know, I know. You're just overwhelmed with emotion.
INTB_D	Fifteen years - seems like only yesterday.
INTB_E	I guess that's a perspective thing.
INTB_F	Hey, doing time for the family is no piece of cake,
INTB_G	but the family looks after its own, ok?
INTB_H	So, how'd the deal go down - you sitting on some white gold?
INTB_I	Look Sonny, we were set up. The deal was an ambush. Harry and Lee are dead.
INTB_J	You better be kidding me Tommy. Tell me you still got the money.
INTB_K	...no Sonny...I don't have the money.
INTB_L	That was my money, Tommy, MY MONEY!
INTB_M	You better not be screwing me Tommy because you know I'm not a man to be screwed with!
INTB_N	Wait Sonny.
INTB_O	You have my personal assurance that I'm going to get your money back and the drugs.
INTB_P	And I'm gonna mail you the dicks of those responsible.
INTB_Q	Hey, I already know that. You're not a fool Tommy, but I warn you, neither am I.
INTB_R	If it was anybody else you'd be DEAD already.
INTB_S	But because it's you, because we got history, I'm gonna let you handle this.
INTB_T	Look, Sonny, you got my word.
INTB_U	I'll be in touch.
