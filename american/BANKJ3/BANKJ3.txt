BJM3_2	~r~Hilary is dead!
BJM3_2A	You Tommy? Of course you're Tommy, I mean,
BJM3_2B	Why else would anyone want to speak to me?
BJM3_2C	OK. Consider it this way -
BJM3_2D	I'll drive for you IF, and only IF, you can drive properly.
BJM3_2E	Leave me alone - and I'll never forgive you.
BJM3_4	~g~You need a car to take part!
BJM3_A	Things are starting to come together nicely here.
BJM3_B	What's the plan, Tommy? Que pasa, amigo?
BJM3_C	The plan is you keep doing that like a moron. Anyhow, we need a driver.
BJM3_D	Tommy, I'll do it. I can drive.
BJM3_E	You want Hilary, mister. Not some smart-talking law school chump.
BJM3_F	Hilary's the real deal. You ain't never seen anyone drive so fast. I'll give him a call here.
BJM3_G	Hey Hil, it's Phil. How's it going? No. don't talk. We'll reminisce later. You want to do me a favor?
BJM3_H	I got me a guy from up north. No, no, I don't think he was in the service, but he wants a driver.
BJM3_I	For a bit of action. Okay, I understand.
BJM3_J	What'd he say?
BJM3_K	Well, he'll do it, no problem. Well, there might be a little problem - see, he has abandonment issues.
BJM3_L	Seems he won't work for anyone who can't beat him. Something to do with his momma.
BJM3_M	Anyway, he wants to race you first, said he'd meet you outside..
BNK3_1	Ok. I'll drive for you, but please, treat me bad.
BNK3_3A	Illegal street race in progress at Vice Point.
BNK3_3B	Calling all officers.
BNK3_3C	Street racers, this is illegal and forbidden!
