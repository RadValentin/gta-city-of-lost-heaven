PRO3_03	~g~ You've left Lance behind, go and get him.
PRO3_04	~g~ Let's go.
PRO3_05	~r~You killed Lance!
PRO3_07	~g~ You have blown your cover. Hurry up and plant the bomb!
PRO3_08	~g~ Get back to ~h~Vercetti Estate~g~ on ~h~Starfish Island~g~.
PRO3_09	Tie 'em up and gag 'em!
PRO3_10	Ooo. Fits perfectly!
PRO3_11	Bit tight around the crotch though...
PRO3_12	Oh yeah yeah, mine too. Mine too.
PRO3_13	Easy brother! No cop drives this bad!
PRO3_14	Remember - smile at the other cops
PRO3_15	Hey there officer. Nice badge, nice badge.
PRO3_16	Real smooth, Lance.
PRO3_17	Ok, timers are set, 5 seconds and ticking.
PRO3_18	5 seconds?!! We got to get the hell out of here!
PRO3_19	Now that got them really irritated.
PRO3_20	~g~ Get two cops to follow you into the garage.
PRO3_21	~g~Get a wanted level so the cops will follow you into the lock-up.
PRO3_22	~g~The lock-up door is blocked! You need to clear the door so it can close.
PRO3_23	~g~Walk into the marker to plant the bomb.
PRO3_24	~g~Get clear of the Cafe!
PRO3_A	You moron! What were you thinking?!
PRO3_A1	Alright.
PRO3_B	Do you realize what this means?!
PRO3_C	We could all be sunk!
PRO3_D	The timer must have got screwed.
PRO3_E	That place was wired to go up like a firework factory.
PRO3_F	Then somebody tipped off the cops...
PRO3_G	What's the problem, fellas?
PRO3_H	Mike was supposed to torch some place in the mall,
PRO3_I	but he screwed the fuses and now the cops are crawling all over it.
PRO3_J	We gotta get our stuff and get out of here!
PRO3_K	Relax, both of you, let me think for a second!
PRO3_L	Tommy Vercetti just doesn't cut and run.
PRO3_M	The cops are gonna be going over that building with a fine toothed comb, right?
PRO3_N	But that takes time.
PRO3_O	We gotta go in and torch that place ourselves.
PRO3_P	Yeah, but...
PRO3_Q	No one but a cop could get within a mile of that place!
PRO3_R	So we go as cops.
PRO3_S	We gotta get uniforms - and we're gonna need a squad car.
PRO3_T	All thanks to you Mike.
PRO3_U	I'm sorry.
PRO3_V	I got it.
PRO3_W	What we got to do is lure the cops in with the finger,
PRO3_X	put them in a lock-up
PRO3_Y	and jump 'em.
PRO3_Z	Good plan. Let's go!
