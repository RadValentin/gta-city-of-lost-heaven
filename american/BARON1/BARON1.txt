COK1_1	Ooh shit!
COK1_10	~g~Go to the thief's house and find out where he's stashing the money.
COK1_11	~g~Have a look through his window.
COK1_2	Too slow grandad!
COK1_4	Loser.
COK1_5	You better keep on running, asshole!
COK1_7	~g~He's escaped to the roof, keep on his tail but don't kill him!
COK1_8	~g~Quick! Grab some wheels and follow him!
COK1_9	~r~You're supposed to follow him, not kill him!
COK1_A	Come on, baby, go! Yeah! Yeah! Arrrrr!
COK1_B	Stupid horse! I'll chop your head off! Grrrrr...
COK1_C	Who is this dickhead?
COK1_D	Tommy Vercetti. You remember me.
COK1_E	Excuse me. I'm a little anxious. Never trust a goddamn horse!
COK1_F	You do a good job - you work for me now.
COK1_G	I work for money.
COK1_H	As I said, amigo, you work for me now. Shut up. Some Judas has betrayed me.
COK1_I	He thinks I don't know how much money I should be making, but stealing 3% is as good as stealing 100%.
COK1_J	No one does this to me. NO ONE!!
COK1_K	You follow him from his apartment and you see where he goes! Later, we will kill him.
