TEX2_A	Tommy, this is Donald Love. Donald, this here is Tommy Vercetti,
TEX2_B	the latest gunslinger to come to these parts.
TEX2_C	Yeh...uh...
TEX2_D	Donald, you just shut up and listen, and you might learn something.
TEX2_E	Now, nothing brings down real estate prices quicker than a good old-fashioned gang war -
TEX2_F	'cept maybe a disaster, like a biblical plague or something,
TEX2_G	but, that may be going too far in this case.
TEX2_H	You getting this down, you four-eyed prick?
TEX2_I	Now recently a Haitian gang lord died. Apparently the Cubans did it, nobody's certain.
TEX2_J	But let's make them certain! You disguise yourself as a Cuban hombre,
TEX2_K	and head on down to crash that funeral. Mix it up, and then high tail it.
TEX2_L	You getting this down, Donald?
TEX2_M	Well, that ought to put the coyote in the chicken coop, huh?
TEX2_N	And then we'll just sit back, and watch the prices tumble.
TEXEXIT	~g~Now get out of Little Haiti!
TEX_2A	~g~Excellent! They've spotted you!
TEX_2B	~r~Fool! People have to WITNESS a Cuban doing the hit!
TEX_2C	~g~Go get yourself some Cuban gang colors in Little Havana!
TEX_2D	~g~Take out the Haitian Gang Lord at Romero's Funeral Parlor!
