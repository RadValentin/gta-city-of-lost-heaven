MOB13_F	We're both businessmen, yeah? You know a good deal when you hear one, ok?
MOB13_G	I don't have time to chat, get to the point.
MOB13_H	MONEY. Money is the goddamned point.
MOB13_I	I've escaped the coop again, but it's never long before they track me down - they think it's a damned game!
MOB13_J	I'm at a pay phone somewhere in this god forsaken shit hole.
MOB13_K	Get me out of here before they take me back and...and..oh go-o-od...
MOB13_L	Well, I'm busy for the next -
MOB13_M	No! Don't shit with me here, have a heart! No man should have to do such, such things.
MOB13_N	I'm on my knees here Tommy, in the dirt begging you please...
MOB13_O	I guess I could swing by that way, see if I can spot you...
MOB13_P	Oh god, they're coming. For the love of Christ hurry, hurry!
MOB15_A	Tommy, mate, it's Paul, from Kent,
MOB15_B	a couple of proper sorts have your name written all over them, down at the Malibu.
MOB15_C	What are you talking about?
MOB15_D	Sorts. Birds. You know. Girls. Tastey ones, don't think they're brasses or nothing.
MOB15_E	You gotta come check them out.
MOB16_A	Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?

MOB21_L	but tell me Tommy, is it true?
MOB21_M	Is what true?
MOB21_N	These stories I hear. Is she really going to be a lawyer?
MOB21_O	Oh Tommy, the shame, the shame! You know, we Cortez's are a proud family.
MOB21_P	We would never allow a daughter of ours to become a lawyer. Please tell me it isn't so. I don't think I could take it.
MOB21_Q	Oh Colonel, I can assure you Mercedes is never going to become a lawyer. Don't worry about it.
MOB21_R	Oh thank you, Tommy. Tommy, thank you. The shame would be unbearable. She is a lady, not a parasite, you know.
MOB21_S	I know, colonel.
MOB21_T	Anyway, Tommy, you must excuse me, the new minister of the interior has arrived.
MOB21_U	Many years ago, I killed his father in a failed coup so I must be polite. Good day, amigo.
MOB22_A	Tommy, you are proving very useful, my friend.
MOB22_B	Thanks, Cortez. What about my deal?

MOB45_J	Just take it easy. This is tough enough without you getting all emotional on me.
MOB45_K	Trust me. Do you hear me, do you hear me?
MOB45_L	I hear you, Tommy, but I can't take this much more.

MOB52_F	Who the hell is this? Put Leo on, man!
MOB52_G	Leo's gone away for a while, he left me in charge.
MOB52_H	Screw you, man!
MOB54_A	Hiya Tommy!
MOB54_B	Hi Mercedes, howyadoin'?
MOB54_C	I got a new apartment up in Vice Point
MOB54_D	- thought you might want to drop by sometime.
MOB54_E	I'd love to. I'll catch you later.
MOB55_A	Tommy, it's me.
MOB55_B	Hi Mercedes.
MOB55_C	Tommy, I so bored, when we going to have some fun?
MOB55_D	What do you mean?
MOB55_E	Well, I know you're busy fighting and killing and corrupting people,
MOB55_F	but I just want to have some fun. So don't forget about me, you hear?
MOB56_A	Tommy, I hear you kill Ricardo Diaz.
MOB56_B	there was an unfortunate fire at his mansion.
MOB56_C	I think he burnt to death in an acrylic shirt.
MOB56_D	Tommy, I so proud of you. I knew you were a real man.
MOB56_E	He awful trouser stain of a man, you make me so proud to be your friend.
MOB56_F	No, I know you going to be busy trying to take over this town,
MOB56_G	but don't forget about me, you hear?
MOB57_A	It's merceedes. I no longer love you Tommy.
MOB57_B	I no longer do. Honest. 'cause you no longer nice to Mercedes.
MOB57_C	You no longer treat her like a lady. You ignore me and I hate you.
MOB57_D	I insist you come to see me right away!
MOB58_A	Tommy.
MOB58_B	Hey Mercedes.
MOB58_C	Hey indeed Mr. Tough Guy. I real angry with you Tommy.
MOB58_D	Never make me hang out with Jezz Torrent again.
MOB58_E	He is pathetic. Half way through he starts crying about his doggie
MOB58_F	that died when he was 7 years old and that his mommy never loved him.
MOB58_G	And Tommy. He wear a wig and a bra in private.
MOB58_H	I not very happy with you!
MOB59_A	Ooh Tommy, its Mercedes.
MOB59_B	I just want to say, I have so much fun on that film set.
MOB59_C	Anything else you have like that, you let me know.
MOB59_D	I really mean that. I always wanted to be an actress.
MOB59_E	I think I learn a lot about the dramatic process.
MOB59_F	It so enlightening! Thank you. Thank you. I see you real soon. Adios.
MOB_01A	Awright me ol'china! It's Paul. I might have a little result for you, but I need to speak to you in person.
MOB_01B	I'm enjoying a little R&R at the Club Malibu.
MOB_01C	Reckon you're gonna owe me a favor or two after this, sunshine. I'll see you later.
MOB_02A	Ssssnniiiiffffff Hey! Hello, Tommy? Tommy!
MOB_02B	We got a situation over at the Print Works. You better go and check it out.
MOB_02C	Some kind of mess or other. Things are messed up. I gotta go.
MOB_03A	Mr. Vercetti? I have here a signed piece of crap stating
MOB_03B	that you have taken on all of BJ's Auto's debts.
MOB_03C	With BJ's sudden disappearance I have no choice
MOB_03D	but to hold you responsible for his financial insecurities.
MOB_03E	Until this account is settled in full
MOB_03F	you should consider Vice City's streets to be very unfriendly.
MOB_04A	How you doin' mate? It's Paulo again.
MOB_04B	Look Tommy, I forgot to mention we're going to need some extra muscle for the concert. A bit of security.
MOB_04C	There's a biker gang led by Mitch Baker, it would be great publicity. Very rock and roll, baby.
MOB_04D	Sort this out for me and I'll get you some back stage passes for the gig, awright?
MOB_05A	Hey, it's Mitch. You did good Tommy, it's good to have the old girl back.
MOB_05B	You tell Kent Paul he'll get his security for the gig.
MOB_05C	You have my word on that.
MOB_05D	Now keep yourself out of trouble.
MOB_06A	Tommy, 'nuf dead man been chattin' about you, my dear.
MOB_06B	Thought you might need something to make you feel better. So Auntie Poulet make you some stew, aye?
MOB_06C	Come by me kitchen some time, ok Tommy?
MOB_08A	Hey Tommy, I thought you might need some business advice.
MOB_08B	Once you got an operation up and running, you'll need to drop by and take the week's cash.
MOB_08C	Let the guys think they got the run of the place and they'll try shaving the profits - ok?
MOB_08D	Hey, I know how to handle business, Ken, ok?
MOB_08E	Ok, ok. I know, you know. I know. I was,
MOB_08F	I was just, you know, telling you I know, that you know, that I know.
MOB_08G	Just keeping it sharp baby!
MOB_08H	Whatever, Ken, whatever...
MOB_09A	Hey Leo! I got some work for you!
MOB_09B	This ain't Leo.
MOB_09C	Hey, if Leo knows you got his phone, he gonna kill you!
MOB_09D	Maybe Leo's already dead. Maybe I killed Leo and took his phone - you think of that prick?
MOB_09E	You killed Leo? You must have big cojones - wanna work for me?!
MOB_09F	Drop by my father's cafe in Little Havana and we'll talk mano a mano.
MOB_10A	Tommy! Look, I gotta ask you a favor.
MOB_10B	Steve! How's filming going!
MOB_10C	Fine, fine. I, heh, WE need a car chase scene, but our budget can't stretch to it.
MOB_10D	I've left some wheels around town. You'll know what to do.
MOB_10E	Ok Steve, I'll keep an eye out. Catch you later.
MOB_11A	Howdy son, just thought I'd ring you up and give you some advice.
MOB_11B	Hey, Avery. What's eating you?
MOB_11C	There's a lot of opportunity in this town if you own the right real estate, you catch my drift?
MOB_11D	I reckon so...
MOB_11E	All I'm saying is keep your eyes open and you might find the perfect business opportunity. I'll catch y'later.
MOB_11F	Later, Avery.
MOB_14A	Hey there Tommy, you're gonna love me mate.
MOB_14B	A little birdy told me that Vice City SWAT Division has a deposit box at a certain rather large banking establishment,
MOB_14C	where they keep all the bribes they've taken over the years,
MOB_14D	like some kind of old boys' retirement fund.
MOB_14E	Of course, if this information should ever help you acquire any of that cash,
MOB_14F	I guess you'd feel obliged to push some of it my way?
MOB_14G	I'll bear that in mind, thanks Kent.
MOB_14H	It's Paul. I'm from Kent, near London, you prat.
MOB_14I	My provincial English geography ain't what it was.
MOB_16A	Tommy, Paulo here, que pasa amigo?
MOB_16B	What do you want Paul? I don't want any fake label clothes.
MOB_16C	Very funny, mate, but you know I don't touch bent gear. Nah, I was just calling to see if I get a part in one your movies.
MOB_16D	Back in England I did a lot of blue stuff, mate. I'm packing more heat than you, my son.
MOB_16E	Paul, thanks for the offer, I'll bear it in mind.
MOB_16F	Seriously, don't forget about me, after all I done for you.
MOB_16G	That's what I'm trying to forget about.
MOB_17A	Tommy Vercetti, how's it going, Mr. big shot? I hear all these things about you, some kind of player in town, now eh...
MOB_17B	Paul, you're drunk.
MOB_17C	Nah, you stupid prat, I ain't drunk. I only had a couple and some treats, ain't been to bed for a couple of days, you know.
MOB_17D	Anyway, don't give me that. I ain't a mug. Who set you up in this town? Who? Me. That's who.
MOB_17F	Really?
MOB_17G	Don't give me that. Don't! I introduced you to people. I showed you the ropes, did a lot of stuff for you, and this is how you repay me.
MOB_17H	You ignore me. You won't give me a way in, after all I did for you! What do you think I am? A div or something?
MOB_17I	Paul, take it easy. I've been busy, don't be an idiot.
MOB_17J	I ain't no idiot, mush. That's what they said in borstal. Are you asking for trouble son, because you're going to get it!
MOB_17K	Tommy, mate. Please. You was my big hope! Please, don't laugh at me!
MOB_17L	Paul, get some sleep, seriously.
MOB_18A	Tommy, it's Paulo, how are you? Right mate, anyway, thought I had to drop you a line.
MOB_18B	Oh my good lord, my son, you will not believe the quality of the brass I just encountered.
MOB_18C	Street walker or something, just down in Little Havana, mate.
MOB_18D	Said her name was Mercedes or something.
MOB_18E	Oh my god, mate. You gotta check this bird out.
MOB_18F	Could strip the lead out of a pencil. Said I was the best she ever had and all.
MOB_18G	Keep you potatoes skinned for her. Be seeing you.
MOB_20A	Alright, Tommy, it's Paul. I just heard from a mush that you've been a real naughty boy.
MOB_20B	Somebody has taken offense to you acting like the big guy all of a sudden, giving it the big shot thing.
MOB_20C	Well, don't say I never warned you or nothing. Boasting is a mug's game, son.
MOB_20D	Anyway, I heard there's some price been put on your head and someone's going to have a crack at you,
MOB_20E	so watch yourself, and remember me, mate.
MOB_24A	Hola, is this Mr. Vercetti?
MOB_24B	Yeah.
MOB_24C	This is Cortez. You were at my party.
MOB_24D	Yeah. I remember.
MOB_24E	Mr. Vercetti, it was a most unfortunate incident that happened with your business deal.
MOB_24F	I know.
MOB_24G	I want you to know me and my people are doing their utmost to get to the bottom of it.
MOB_24H	If you'd like to talk to me more privately, you can find me at the boat, eh? Okay? Good day, senor.
MOB_25A	Tommy, Thomas it's Cortez. Look, the French are giving me all kinds of trouble, amigo.
MOB_25B	Damn hypocrites. They spend a hundred years stealing from poor countries and they call me a thief!
MOB_25C	I am going to need your help as soon as possible, amigo.
MOB_25D	So please hurry, Tommy, I need you, all right? I hate the damn French.
MOB_26A	Hello, Tommy?
MOB_26B	Yeah?
MOB_26C	It's Baker. I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show.
MOB_26D	Me and the boys want to thank you, and remind you,
MOB_26E	you got our respect. Good day. Keep riding hard, son.
MOB_29A	Hello, is this Mr. Tommy Vercetti?
MOB_29B	Yes.
MOB_29C	Well, I hear through the vine of grapes you the man when someone got a vermin infestation.
MOB_29D	Maybe...
MOB_29E	Well, I got a real vermin infestation. Haitians everywhere.
MOB_29F	My name is Umberto Robina and I want you to meet me at the Cafe Robina as soon as you can,
MOB_29G	'cause I tell you, these damn Haitians gone too far this time.
MOB_29H	Test
MOB_30A	Tommy, is Umberto Robina
MOB_30B	Hey, how's the cafe?
MOB_30C	Oh, wonderful. Incredible. Tommy, incredible. No wimps, Tommy, just real men, and the beautiful women!
MOB_30D	Anyway, I wanted to tell you, me and Papi, to us, you Cuban.
MOB_30E	You have proved yourself, man. You got big cojones.
MOB_30F	Well thank you, Umberto. Nobody's said that to me since I left jail. I'll see you around.
MOB_33A	Tommy, it's Phil, now cut out all the reminiscing crap and listen to me, you hear?
MOB_33B	Good. I got me some extra strength boomshine nearing fermentation time and I was wondering if you'd fancy having a shot.
MOB_33C	Seriously, Tommy, if you like a drink, or if you need to strip paint, this stuff'll make a man out of you.
MOB_33D	Sure did out of me, even though I can't see out of one eye. I'll be waiting for you, y'hear.
MOB_34A	Tommy, I really enjoyed working with you. Ain't had so much fun since the ridge in Nam, pal.
MOB_34B	Anyhows, you need anything, you call on me, you hear?
MOB_34C	I always remember those I served with,
MOB_34D	and I am sure I can help you out, you hear?
MOB_35A	Tommy, the wound is healing well. Funny thing is,
MOB_35B	I have fought in 6 battle zones and always walked away without a scratch, and now this!
MOB_35C	One armed Phil. Still, I got me a healthy selection of one handed fire power so I'll never be unarmed Phil, you hear.
MOB_35D	Any way son, cut out the sentimental crap and go buy yourself a drink, you hear!
MOB_36A	Tommy, it's Phil, I want to thank you for helping me out back there son,
MOB_36B	Damn Charlie, he'll always ambush you somewhere or other,
MOB_36C	Anyway the wound is healing well, and it means I'll no longer be defrauding the government on my disability check.
MOB_40A	Hey Tommy, it's Sonny. How's the sun tan?
MOB_40B	I ain't got no sun tan.
MOB_40C	Well, you ain't got my money, either, so I'm wondering to myself,
MOB_40D	what are you doing? So, tell me, Tommy, what are you doing?
MOB_40E	I'm looking for the money, Sonny. Don't worry.
MOB_40F	I am worrying, Tommy, that's my style,
MOB_40G	because I seem to have this problem in my life with unreliable people.
MOB_40H	Don't be an unreliable person, Tommy, please.
MOB_40I	Do us both a favor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
MOB_41A	Tommy, remember me?
MOB_41B	Hello Sonny.
MOB_41C	That's right, Sonny. We're old friends,
MOB_41D	You never write me, you never call. Don't you want to be friends no more?
MOB_41E	I've been busy trying to sort things out. You didn't give me a lot of support down here, Sonny.
MOB_41F	Oh, my fault is it? We'll I've heard you been busy all right.
MOB_41G	Busy killing drugs barons. Busy taking over.
MOB_41H	Don't forget about us, Tommy, 'cause I can assure you, I ain't forgotten about you.
MOB_42A	Tommy.
MOB_42B	Sonny.
MOB_42C	Obviously you are suffering from hearing problems, so I'll try again.
MOB_42D	Where's the goddamned money, where's the goddamned stuff, and where's my cut of your new action?
MOB_42E	You are making an idiot out of me, Tommy, and I'm not laughing yet.
MOB_43A	Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, I had Sonny on the phone, ok, are you with me?.
MOB_43B	I don't know about you, but there's something about a man threatening to murder my family
MOB_43C	which really scares the crap out of me. What are you going to do?
MOB_43D	Ken, take it easy.
MOB_43E	I AM calm, calm as a man can be when he's fearing for his life!
MOB_43F	Stay off the idiot fuel and look after yourself.
MOB_43G	No one's gonna take us out. I'll see you later.
MOB_43H	I am calm. Don't I sound calm? Must be impending death that is doing this to my voice.
MOB_47A	Tommy, Lance, we got big problems. Come down here. Right away.
MOB_62A	Tommy, is Ricardo Diaz, I want to thank you for looking out for me my man.
MOB_62B	I ask that prick Cortez, he say you the real deal, my friend, why you not come see me.
MOB_62C	I need a guy like you. All I have now is dickheads,
MOB_62D	dickheads everywhere, yo. I make you real rich.
MOB_63A	Tommy, it's Earnest. Earnest Kelly.
MOB_63B	How are you?
MOB_63C	I'm doing okay. I'll need a stick to walk, but I should be back at work soon enough.
MOB_63D	Good.
MOB_63E	I heard about Lance. What a little prick, eh?
MOB_63F	Yes.
MOB_63G	Never trust a man who walks the streets in his pajamas. That's what I say. Glad you killed him. I hope it was painful for the prick.
MOB_63H	I think it was. I just didn't think he was like that...
MOB_63I	Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you're pretty naive. I'll be back at work soon, teach you a thing or two about life, you hear.
MOB_63J	Take your time, Earnest. Look after yourself.
MOB_66A	Tommy, Tommy why you coming back here for?
MOB_66B	I tell you we don't want to see you around here no more.
MOB_67A	Tommy, me thinks you should be staying away, you hear?
MOB_67B	The Haitian boys not too 'appy with you.
MOB_68A	Tommy son, have I got a surprise for you
MOB_68B	I'm down at the recording studios with some major artists
MOB_68C	Why don't you pay us a visit?
MOB_68D	You know it makes sense, dontcha? See ya later.
MOB_70A	Tommy, it's me, Colonel Cortez. Look senor, I believe you are a man who can get things done. So please help me.
MOB_70B	You can find me at the boat.
MOB_72A	Tommy, it's me, Lance. Keep your mouth shut there Tommy, 'cause I ain't got time to talk.
MOB_72B	I ain't interested in what you got to say. Why should I be? You don't care about me, do you?
MOB_72C	You gotta look after me a bit better. Give me a fair slice. You know...
MOB_72D	Tommy... oh, look, man, I'm sorry. It's just that...
MOB_72E	People patronize me all my life, treat me like a little kid.
MOB_72F	My brother would do that. Please, man, don't do that.
MOB_72G	I gotta go.
MOB_73A	Tommy, it's Steve.
MOB_73B	Hey, Steve.
MOB_73C	Hey indeed, genius. You're a marvel! I'm a marvel! They love us. We are re-writing the record books, pal.
MOB_73D	We are talking major awards here. Finally, I can put my dad in a home an tell him to shut up.
MOB_73E	Eeer, that's cool, Steve.
MOB_73F	Cool? It's hot, man. Hot. H. O. T. He never believed in me. Never thought I was an artist, and now I've made it.
MOB_73G	I'm the best damn skin flick director of all time, my friend. I just wanted to say, it's a pleasure to have met you.
MOB_73H	Thanks steve.
MOB_73I	I love you, baby. Don't go changing on me, you hear.
MOB_73J	I hear you. Good bye, Steve.
