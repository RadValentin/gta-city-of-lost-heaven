DEFSAFE	~g~Get back to the safe and defend it.
FIN1_01	What's going on?
FIN1_02	Tommy! Oh good, good. Listen, listen. Uh, listen,
FIN1_03	I like fish. I love fish.
FIN1_04	I love them as pets in bowls, or as food on a plate,
FIN1_05	but as much as I love em, I don't want to sleep with them.
FIN1_06	Okay, but right now your Italian brothers are coming from up there to fit me with some cement shoes, and I...
FIN1_07	Shut up Ken. Sit down.
FIN1_08	Lance, what the hell's going on?
FIN1_09	It's your friends up north Tommy. They ain't too happy you capped their man.
FIN1_10	They're coming down to see the business today.
FIN1_11	They took longer than I thought...
FIN1_12	Guys, we gotta make this final we gotta leave no doubt that this is my operation. Mine!
FIN1_13	Ken, you get the first run of counterfeit cash and put three mil in briefcases.
FIN1_14	Lance, you get the guys together...
FIN2_01	Tommy!
FIN2_02	What? No big hugs for your old buddy?
FIN2_03	I've had fifteen years out of the loop,
FIN2_04	I'm a bit rusty on family etiquette.
FIN2_05	Always angry, eh Tommy.
FIN2_06	Didn't I say your temper would get you into trouble, huh?
FIN2_07	There's three mil in the cases...
FIN2_08	How many was it? Ten? No, eleven men.
FIN2_09	That's how you get to be called the Harwood Butcher! Heh-heh-heh!
FIN2_10	You sent me to kill one man, ONE MAN. They knew I was coming Sonny...
FIN2_11	Tommy, Tommy, watch your tone.
FIN2_12	Anyone would think you blame me for that unfortunate set of circumstances.
FIN2_13	Just take the money...
FIN2_14	Get the damn cash.
FIN2_15	You know, Tommy? I did what I could for you, I pulled strings, called in favors.
FIN2_16	I was your friend, Tommy. I hoped you'd see sense, see what's good for business.
FIN2_17	I trusted you, Tommy, and you disappointed me.
FIN2_18	But at least someone in your chicken shit organization knows how to do business,
FIN2_19	Isn't that right, Lance?
FIN2_20	I'm sorry Tommy. This is Vice City. This is business.
FIN2_21	You sold us out...
FIN2_22	No. I sold YOU out, Tommy, I sold YOU out.
FIN2_23	The real cash is upstairs in the safe.
FIN2_24	Tommy, what was the big plan?
FIN2_25	You think I'd just take the fake cash?
FIN2_26	Save face and run away with my tail between my legs?!
FIN2_27	No.
FIN2_28	I just wanted to piss you off before I kill you.
FIN3_01	Tommy?
FIN3_02	Oh my god, Tommy! What happened?
FIN3_03	What does it look like?
FIN3_04	It looks like you ruined your suit!
FIN3_05	and Tommy, that was a beautiful suit! Tommy, what on earth happened?
FIN3_06	I had a disagreement with a business associate, you know how it is.
FIN3_07	Tommy, I have a disagreement, I send them an angry letter.
FIN3_08	Maybe I pee in their mailbox. I don't start World War III.
FIN3_09	You know, maybe you should speak to my shrink...
FIN3_10	That stupid prick, Lance...
FIN3_11	Tommy. I never liked that guy, okay?
FIN3_12	He's neurotic, he's insecure, he's self-centered - the guy's an asshole!
FIN3_13	I'm glad you took him out!
FIN3_14	I don't think we're gonna be getting any more heat from up north either...
FIN3_15	...'cause there ain't no 'up north', anymore.
FIN3_16	It's all down south now.
FIN3_17	Wait, does that mean what I think it means..? Tommy, baby!
FIN3_18	What do you think it means?
FIN3_19	That we're in charge... I mean, that you're in charge. Oh, Tommy!
FIN3_20	You know, Ken. I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful business relationship....
FIN3_21	After all, you're a conniving, backstabbing, two-bit thief
FIN3_22	and I'm a convicted psychotic killer and drug dealer.
FIN3_23	I know. Ain't it just beautiful?
FIN_B1	~g~Go and kill ~y~Lance Vance~g~ the backstabber.
